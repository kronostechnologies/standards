# ASR-00: Record architecturally significant requirements

Status: Accepted

## Context

In software development, architectural decisions play a crucial role in shaping the structure and behavior of a system.
These decisions are often made informally and may not be adequately documented, leading to challenges in understanding
the rationale behind them, especially for new team members or when revisiting the architecture after some time.
Moreover, as more products and services are built within a product family, the complexity of managing and maintaining
these systems increases. Aligning architectural decisions across multiple products becomes essential to ensure
consistency, interoperability, and maintainability.

## Decision

To address these challenges, we have decided to adopt a practice of documenting all architecturally significant
requirements (ASRs) using a common template. ASRs will be created for each major decisions that impact the
decision-making process across the whole product family. New ASRs will follow the numbering sequence (e.g., ASR-01,
ASR-02, etc.) to maintain order and facilitate referencing.

ASRs may not be deleted, but they can be deprecated when they are no longer relevant or have been superseded by new
decisions.

ASRs will be reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect changes in the architecture or new insights gained during
development. Ownership of ASRs will be assigned to the Tech Leads, who will be responsible for ensuring that the
documents are kept up to date and relevant.

ASR documents will be stored in a dedicated directory within
the https://github.com/kronostechnologies/standards/tree/master/asr (e.g., `asr/`) to ensure easy access and
organization. Each ASR will follow a standardized template to ensure consistency and clarity.

## Consequences

1. Improved Communication: Documenting decisions will enhance communication among team members, ensuring everyone
   understands the rationale behind architectural requirements.
2. Historical Reference: ASRs will serve as a historical record of decisions, aiding future developers in understanding
   the evolution of the requirements.
3. Better Decision-Making: The process of documenting decisions encourages thorough consideration of options and their
   implications.
4. Potential Overhead: The process of documenting decisions may introduce some overhead.
5. Consistency: Using a standardized format for ASRs will ensure consistency in documentation.

## ASR Template

Each ASR will follow a standardized template to ensure consistency and clarity. The template will include the following
sections:

1. Title: A concise title summarizing the decision.
2. Status: The current status of the decision (e.g., Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated).
3. Context: A description of the context and background leading to the decision.
4. Decision: A clear statement of the decision made.
5. Consequences: An analysis of the consequences of the decision, including both positive and negative impacts.
6. Alternatives Considered: When relevant, a brief overview of alternative options that were considered and why they
   were not chosen.
7. Related Decisions: References to other ASRs that are related to this decision.
