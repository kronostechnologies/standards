# ASR-01: Repository management

Status: Accepted

## Context

In software development, managing code repositories effectively is crucial for collaboration, version control, and
maintaining the integrity of the codebase. As teams grow and projects become more complex, the need for a standardized
approach to repository management becomes evident. Different teams may have varying practices, leading to
inconsistencies that can hinder productivity and increase the risk of errors. To ensure smooth collaboration and
maintain high-quality code, it is essential to establish clear guidelines and practices for repository management that
align with the overall architectural goals of the organization.

## Decision

To address these challenges, we have decided to implement a standardized repository management strategy that includes
the following key practices:

1. **Centralized Repository**: All code will be stored in a centralized version control system (e.g., Github) to
   facilitate collaboration and ensure a single source of truth.
2. **Branching Strategy**: We will adopt a consistent branching strategy to manage development and releases effectively.
    - The *main branch* will be protected and only allow merges through pull requests after successful reviews, tests
      and automated validations.
    - *Release branches* will be prefixed with "release/" will be protected and only allow merges through pull requests
      after successful reviews and tests. Feature flags should be favored over release branches when possible.
    - *Feature branches* will be prefixed with "feature/" and will be created for specific features or bug fixes. These
      branches will be merged into the development branch after successful code reviews and testing.
    - *Development branches* will be prefixed with "dev/" and will be used for ongoing development work.
3. **Code Reviews**: All code changes will undergo peer reviews to maintain code quality and share knowledge among team
   members.
4. **Ticket Linking**: Each pull request must reference, in its title, a corresponding ticket in the issue tracking
   system (e.g., Jira) to ensure traceability and context for changes.
5. **Documentation**: Each repository will include comprehensive documentation, including a README file, contribution
   guidelines, and coding standards.

## Consequences

1. Improved Collaboration: A standardized approach will enhance collaboration among team members, making it easier to
   work together on code.
2. Consistency: Adopting common practices will ensure consistency across repositories, reducing confusion and errors.
3. Enhanced Code Quality: Code reviews and commit standards will help maintain high-quality code and facilitate
   knowledge sharing.
4. Scalability: A well-defined repository management strategy will support the growth of the team and the complexity of
   projects over time. By adopting this repository management strategy, we aim to improve the overall efficiency and
   quality of our software development process.
